## Goal of the Project
Create a signature app that had smoother drawing. Most signature scripts out there have weird pixel jumps that make your signature look nothing like the real one. By just using a little math and pattern recognition, the signature was smoothed out. I didn't fix how going out of the signature box and coming back in creates a line, but I would say my initial goal was completed. [Check it out here](https://codepen.io/brentbachelder/full/gOjWvmj).
